pinbasic v1.1 (Release Date: 2017-03-01)
----------------------------------------------------------------

Fixes:

  * `pin_confint` for `ncores = 1`; `seed` is set once at the beginning, hence results differ slightly from them of earlier version

Changes:

  * Code clean-up for `pin_confint` and thus less dependencies; `ncores = 1` by default now
  * Confidence interval computations invoked by `pin_est_core`, `pin_est` or `qpin` use only 1 CPU core by default now
  * Likelihood factorizations are re-implemented with `Rcpp`
  * `simulateBS` function is re-implemented with `Rcpp`

pinbasic v1.0.1 (Release Date: 2017-01-11)
----------------------------------------------------------------

Fixes:

  * fixed NOTES reported by CRAN checks



pinbasic v1.0.0 (Release Date: 2017-01-09)
----------------------------------------------------------------

New Functions:

  * `posterior`: calculates posterior probabilities for trading days' conditions
  * `ggplot.posterior`: Method for `ggplot` function for handling objects with class 'posterior' (Results from `posterior` function)

Changes:

  * `pin_confint`: using `iter` function from `iterators` package to iterate over list of simulated datasets if executed in parallel
                   which gains little speed-up in execution time
  * `qpin_plot` changed to `ggplot.qpin`: Method for `ggplot` function for handling objects with class 'qpin' (Results from `qpin` function)

Fixes:

  * fixed missing convergence code in optimization routines if `num_best_res = 1`



pinbasic v0.2.0 (Release Date: 2016-12-02)
----------------------------------------------------------------

New Functions:

  * simulateBS() for simulating daily buys and sells data

  * pin_confint(): computes confidence intervals for the probability of informed trading
    Changes

Changes:

  * `pin_est_core`, `pin_est` and `qpin` gained two new arguments: `confint` and `ci_control`

  * updated plotting structure for qpin_plot, facets are now grouped by probability parameters,
    intensity parameters and the probability of informed trading

  * initial_vals together with method = "HAC_Ref" now returns a number of sets of initial values
    depending on num_clust argument, not only one set

  * Vignette was added



pinbasic v0.1.0 (Release Date: 2016-10-25)
----------------------------------------------------------------

* initial release
