## Static Models

This section describes static models for estimating the probability of
informed trading.
As mentioned before, the word *static* takes into account that these
models assume constant arrival rates for daily buys and sells.
Additionally, the probability parameters are also assumed to be constant over the whole range spanned
by the data.
Therefore the usage of these models do not enable to estimate the probability of informed trading
on a daily basis.

The static models have several assumptions in common.
Firstly, the sequence of trading days is assumed to be discrete and independent,
whereas the time during a trading day is continuous.
Conditions of trading days are not observable and determined by nature before the market opening.
*Information events*, days on which private, price-relevant information enter the market, occur
with probability $\probinfevent$.
These are good information with probability $1 - \probbadnews$ and news with negative direction
with probability $\probbadnews$.
Hence, the probabilities of no-news, good-news and bad-news days are given by:
$$
\begin{align}
  \prsym(\nonews) &= 1 - \probinfevent  \\
  \prsym(\goodnews) &= \probinfevent  ( 1 - \probbadnews)  \\
  \prsym(\badnews) &= \probinfevent  \probbadnews 
\end{align}
$$
Furthermore, buys and sells are supposed
to follow latent independent Poisson processes with constant intensities.
A Poisson process is point process which is often defined on the positive line.
According to @daley2003,

> we shall understand by a point process some method of randomly allocating points to the real line.

However, in terms of arrivals of buys and sells, we assume the Poisson processes in the static $\pintext$ models
to be defined on the positive half-line.
Poisson processes are directly related to the corresponding discrete Poisson distribution which is defined by the
following cumulative distribution function (cdf) and probability mass fun
$$
\begin{align}
  \text{cdf}: \:\:  F\left(\lambda;n\right) = \exp\left(-\lambda\right)
                \sum\limits_{k=0}^n \dfrac{\lambda^k}{k!} \qquad \qquad
  \text{pmf}: \:\:  f\left(\lambda;k\right) = \exp\left(-\lambda\right)
                \dfrac{\lambda^k}{k!} \notag ,
\end{align}
$$
with the number of arrivals $n$, the intensity parameter $\lambda$ and $k \in \mathbb{N}$.
The mean and variance of the Poisson distribution are equal and given by the parameter $\lambda$.
Waiting times or interarrival times between two consecutive buys or sells are exponentially distributed.
The exponential distribution is a continuous distribution which has cdf and probability density function (pdf) given below,
$$
\begin{align}
  \text{cdf}: \:\:  F\left(\lambda;x\right) = 1 - \exp\left(-\lambda x\right) \qquad \qquad
  \text{pdf}: \:\:  f\left(\lambda;x\right) = \lambda \exp\left(-\lambda x\right) \notag .
\end{align}
$$
On information events, the intensity of the Poisson process for buys or sells is increased by a positive constant parameter $\intensinf$,
depending on the direction of information.
The arrivals of transactions, which are indeed observable, can be interpreted
as a merging of both latent point processes.
The observable arrivals of transactions $N_{O}$ are the outcome of a competition between the
the latent Poisson processes for buys and sells, $N_{B}$ and $N_{S}$,
which is the first to arrive.
The waiting times of the latent Poisson processes determines the direction of the next trade.
Assuming that the current waiting time of the buys' point process is less than the sells' interarrival time,
the observed transaction will be buyer-initiated and $N_{B}$ increases by 1 as well as $N_{O}$, whereas
$N_{S}$ remains unchanged.^[For most exchanges no data is available about the direction of transactions.
Due to this reason algorithms like *Lee & Ready* are used to try to detect if
a transaction is buyer- or seller-initiated [see @LeeReady].]
After observing a transaction the waiting times of both latent point processes are reset
and the race of buys and sells process begins anew.

<!-- Using \thref{th:poissonmerge}  -->
Hence, we can write down the probabilities of observing a buyer-
or seller-initiated transaction for all three possible states of a trading day $\daysym$.
For a no-news day the probabilities of observing a buy or sell at each point in time
can be written incorporating the corresponding intensities of the point processes of buys and sells,
$$
\begin{aligned}
    \prsym\left(I_{k,d} = \text{Buy} \right) &= \dfrac{\lambdabuysconst}
                                           {\lambdabuysconst + \lambdasellsconst} \\ \\
    \prsym\left(I_{k,d} = \text{Sell} \right) &= \dfrac{\lambdasellsconst}
                                                   {\lambdabuysconst + \lambdasellsconst},
\end{aligned}
$$
where $I_k$ is the $k$-th observation of the merged Poisson process of transactions and $k$ equals any integer smaller
than the total number of transactions on trading day $\daysym$.
On a good-news day informed traders enter the market but only act as buyers,
therefore the rate of informed buys must be taken into account,
$$
\begin{aligned}
  \prsym\left(I_{k,d} = \text{Buy} \right) &= \prsym\left(I_{k,d} = \text{uninf. Buy} \right) + \prsym\left(I_{k,d} = \text{inf. Buy} \right) \\
                                       &= \dfrac{\lambdabuysconst + \lambdabuysinfconst}
                                         {\lambdabuysconst + \lambdasellsconst + \lambdabuysinfconst} \\ \\
  \prsym\left(I_{k,d} = \text{Sell} \right) &= \dfrac{\lambdasellsconst}
                                                 {\lambdabuysconst + \lambdasellsconst + \lambdabuysinfconst}. 
\end{aligned}
$$
Informed sellers solely occur on a bad-news day.
Similar to good-news days, the rate of informed sells must be incorporated in probabilities,
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \prsym\left(I_{k,d} = \text{Buy} \right) &= \dfrac{\lambdabuysconst}
                                           {\lambdabuysconst + \lambdasellsconst + \lambdasellsinfconst} \\ \\
    \prsym\left(I_{k,d} = \text{Sell} \right) &= \prsym\left(I_{k,d} = \text{uninf. Sell} \right) + \prsym\left(I_{k,d} = \text{inf. Sell} \right) \\
                                          &= \dfrac{\lambdasellsconst + \lambdasellsinfconst}
                                             {\lambdabuysconst + \lambdasellsconst + \lambdasellsinfconst}. 
  \end{aligned}
