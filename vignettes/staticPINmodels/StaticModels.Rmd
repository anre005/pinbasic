## EHO Model

This section describes the static model for estimating the probability of
informed trading developed by @EHO.
<!-- As mentioned before, the word *static* takes into account that these -->
<!-- models assume constant arrival rates for daily buys and sells. -->
Arrival rates of buys and sells as well as
probability parameters are assumed to be constant over the whole range spanned
by the data.
Therefore the usage of this models do not enable to estimate the probability of informed trading
on a daily basis.

<!-- The static models have several assumptions in common. -->
<!-- Firstly,  -->
The sequence of trading days is assumed to be discrete and independent,
whereas the time during a trading day is continuous.
Conditions of trading days are not observable and determined by nature before the market opening.
*Information events*, days on which private, price-relevant information enter the market, occur
with probability $\probinfevent$.
These are good information with probability $1 - \probbadnews$ and news with negative direction
with probability $\probbadnews$.
Hence, the probabilities of no-news, good-news and bad-news days are given by:
$$
\begin{align}
  \prsym(\nonews) &= 1 - \probinfevent  \\
  \prsym(\goodnews) &= \probinfevent  ( 1 - \probbadnews)  \\
  \prsym(\badnews) &= \probinfevent  \probbadnews 
\end{align}
$$
Furthermore, buys and sells are supposed
to follow latent independent Poisson processes with constant intensities.
A Poisson process is a point process which is often defined on the positive line.
According to @daley2003,

> we shall understand by a point process some method of randomly allocating points to the real line.

However, in terms of arrivals of buys and sells, we assume the Poisson processes in the static $\pintext$ models
to be defined on the positive half-line.^[
Poisson processes are directly related to the corresponding discrete Poisson distribution which is defined by the
following cumulative distribution function (cdf) and probability mass fun
$$
\begin{align}
  \text{cdf}: \:\:  F\left(\lambda;n\right) = \exp\left(-\lambda\right)
                \sum\limits_{k=0}^n \dfrac{\lambda^k}{k!} \qquad \text{and} \qquad
  \text{pmf}: \:\:  f\left(\lambda;k\right) = \exp\left(-\lambda\right)
                \dfrac{\lambda^k}{k!} \notag ,
\end{align}
$$
with the number of arrivals $n$, the intensity parameter $\lambda$ and $k \in \mathbb{N}$.]
<!-- The mean and variance of the Poisson distribution are equal and given by the parameter $\lambda$.] -->
Waiting times or interarrival times between two consecutive buys or sells are exponentially distributed.^[
The exponential distribution is a continuous distribution which has cdf and probability density function (pdf) given below,
$$
\begin{align}
  \text{cdf}: \:\:  F\left(\lambda;x\right) = 1 - \exp\left(-\lambda x\right) \qquad \text{and} \qquad
  \text{pdf}: \:\:  f\left(\lambda;x\right) = \lambda \exp\left(-\lambda x\right) \notag ,
\end{align}
$$
with rate parameter $\lambda$.]
On information events, the intensity of the Poisson process for buys or sells is increased by a positive constant parameter $\intensinf$,
depending on the direction of information.
The arrivals of transactions, which are indeed observable, can be interpreted
as a merging of both latent point processes.^[
The merging of two homogeneous independent Poisson processes
again yields a Poisson process, e.g. see @firstcourse.]
The observable arrivals of transactions $N_{O}$ are the outcome of a competition between 
the latent Poisson processes for buys and sells, $N_{B}$ and $N_{S}$,
which is the first to arrive.
The waiting times of the latent Poisson processes determines the direction of the next trade.
Assuming that the current waiting time of the buys' point process is less than the sells' interarrival time,
the observed transaction will be buyer-initiated and $N_{B}$ increases by 1 as well as $N_{O}$, whereas
$N_{S}$ remains unchanged.^[For most exchanges no data is available about the direction of transactions.
Due to this reason algorithms like *Lee & Ready* are used to try to detect if
a transaction is buyer- or seller-initiated [see @LeeReady].]
After observing a transaction the waiting times of both latent point processes are reset
and the race of buys and sells process begins anew.
