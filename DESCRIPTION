Description: Utilities for fast and stable estimation of the probability of 
 informed trading (PIN) in the model introduced by Easley et al. (2002) 
 <DOI:10.1111/1540-6261.00493> are implemented. Since the basic model developed 
 by Easley et al. (1996) <DOI:10.1111/j.1540-6261.1996.tb04074.x> is nested in the 
 former due to equating the intensity of uninformed buys and sells, functionalities 
 can also be applied to this simpler model structure, if needed.
