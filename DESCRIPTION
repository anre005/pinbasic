Description: Utilities for fast and stable estimation of the probability of 
 informed trading (PIN) in the model introduced by Easley et al. (2002) 
 are implemented. Since the basic model developed by Easley et al. (1996) 
 is nested in the former due to equating the intensity of uninformed buys 
 and sells, functionalities can also be applied to this simpler model structure, if needed.
